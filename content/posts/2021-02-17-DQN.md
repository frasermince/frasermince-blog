As I have begun to listen to lectures and learn more about reinforcement
learning I have wanted to do something more hands on to truly learn how
to build. To that end I decided to start going through many of the papers found
in the OpenAI spinning up guide and try to start getting my hands dirty. I
started with the Seminal paper the DQN. This paper develops an algorithm to
perform well at Atari games. 

## Algorithm
Specifically it uses what is called value iteration. Meaning that it uses the
reward 
- Bellman Equation
- Value Iteration
- Function Approximation

## What I learned
- Problems I had
- Pytorch lightning

## Variations
