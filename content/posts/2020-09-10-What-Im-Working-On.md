In April I lost my job as a Software Engineer. I had long wanted to venture out and spend time trying to become a successful indie hacker. I also wanted to level up my machine learning skills to pursue a career in research. So I decided to view this as an opportunity to learn as much as possible, build new things, and up my skills while living off some unemployment and savings. This article will serve as a log of what I’ve done so far and a plan for the future.

## So Far

Upon losing my job I had been working on a project for several months called [Unchart](https://unchart.io). I had gotten into language learning and discovered how helpful reading was for learning a new language. I spent the next several months making my idea a reality first by building a flashcard and spaced repetition system and then through polishing, making an android app and talking to users.

If you also are interested in entrepreneurship you may have caught something off about that last sentence. Despite knowing better, I spent months working on a project without first talking to a large number of prospective users. Finally after months of not doing so, I started doing the [mom test](http://momtestbook.com/) with micro language influencers on Instagram. 

While I got some interest I didn’t exactly feel like I had found a core problem in their language learning. This was also paired with a very low retention rate within the app. I felt like I had found a solution instead of a problem. So after months of being hyper focused on one thing I decided it’s time to broaden my horizons and consider what I want to do moving forward.

## Long Term Goals
I have two long term goals for my career: to build products that people love and to be on the cutting edge of what computing can do through machine learning. At this point I feel pretty far away from accomplishing either of them so I’ve decided to make a plan to move towards my goals. The big pieces of what I want to do moving forward are the following:

  1. Continue work on my current project: I started Unchart with the intention of making language learning easier and more fun. I myself was getting really bored just doing Duolingo and I knew reading books increased my vocabulary a ton in my native language. I started to believe it could do the same in my target language. So I ambitiously or foolishly decided to jump into Harry Potter in French. There was only one problem though. It was really hard. I was overwhelmed by all the grammar and vocabulary I didn't know. So I decided to make tools to make it easier to read in the moment and then make flashcards afterwards. Moving forward I hope to get some interest in the long tail via a [blog article I wrote](https://blog.unchart.io/posts/how-to-learn-a-language-on-your-own) about language learning. I will also do more user tests and continue to talk to people about the idea.
  2. Explore new ideas: I am really inspired by [Pieter Levels' challenge](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/) to make 12 startups in 12 months and want to try my own hand at churning out ideas and seeing if they have a market.
  3. Learn more about machine learning: I am really captivated by the frontiers we as humanity may reach. I really want to be on the cutting edge of research in AI. I dream someday of grad school, research, and being a professor. But while my academic experience was okay it was never amazing and I know I am going to have show something impressive if I'm going to get into a good program. So I am going to use this time to pursue my interests in NLP, and Reinforcement Learning as well as building up the mathematical knowledge necessary to understand everything that is going on.
  4. Write: It is often said that the best way to learn is to teach. So as I learn new things and explore new domains I will write about it here.

So every week I want to do the following to further my academic and entrepreneurial goals:
  1. Reach out to at least 5 people in a field I am interested in and ask them what problems they have using the Mom test.
  2. Read at least one research paper
  3. Work on 1 Kaggle contest (or similar problem) in Machine learning
  4. Spend at least 4 hours catching up on math that I definitely don’t remember from college
  5. Write a blog article about what I have learned or done that week

## What I’m Doing To Start
  1. Kaggle - I plan to start by working on the [Contradictory Sentence Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/contradictory-my-dear-watson) to continue to familiarize myself with NLP. I had previously worked on the [Jigsaw competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification) to detect toxicity in online comments using BERT. However I was using pytorch and at the time TPUs were not yet supported. This has changed since then so it should be much more possible this time around to use pytorch with TPUs.
  2. City Planning - I was really inspired by Marc Andreessen’s article [It’s Time To Build](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/) and I want to play a part in that big picture building. To start with I’m really interested in how machine learning and specifically computer vision can change how we plan our cities. More concretely I'm interested in seeing if I can build something that can technologically accomplish one or more of the following goals:
    1. Make cities greener thus effecting the climate and mental health of residents in cities.
    2. Reduce sprawl and make cities more human centered.
    3. Makes cities more beautiful.

  I understand the main blockers to this are on the policy level but I am curious if there are technological roadblocks I can help solve. So I have been doing research on advances on city planning and want to reach out to city planners to see what problems they have. So far I have found a recently released paper on city planning and adversarial learning https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.09912.pdf. And found articles about how Singapore has gone about planning using geospatial data: https://www.brinknews.com/data-analytics-in-urban-planning-new-tools-for-old-problems/. 
  3. Statistics - In college I did not pay much attention in my statistics class. I barely ever went to class and just coasted. I really regret this. At the time I was young, stupid and viewed statistics as boring. As I have gotten older I have seen more and more how important statistics are for understanding what is true. 2020 has reinforced this more than anything else with the sheer amount of misinformation circulating about COVID-19. I want to up my understanding of statistics for both future ML interests as well as general life interests. I plan to work through an [older course](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+STAT110x+2T2017/course/) I started a while ago. I hope this can further my ability to understand reinforcement learning as well as mentioned in the OpenAI [Spinning up in RL guide](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/spinningup.html#the-right-background)

In summary there will be a lot more blog articles to come! Stay tuned to seem
